        <p><b>Some of my earliest memories of the internet are of playing various games on the family desktop.
            While I liked playing <span>short</span> flash games on websites like<span> CoolMathGames.com,</span> Poptropica, and Funbrain Playground, I was always more entranced by
            <span>children's</span> MMO (massively multiplayer online) games. I spents hours everyday on games like Club Penguin, Pixie Hollow, Petpet Park, and most of all, Toontown Online.
            I sunk an unfathomable amount of time running around virtual worlds, doing fetch quests, grinding in-game curency, and leveling up my accounts. To say that these
            companies had me hooked would be an <span>understatement</span>.
            <br> <br> (Fun fact: There is a fan-run <span>revival</span> of Toontown Online named "Toontown Rewritten" currently ongoing. It is a complete recreation of the original Towntown. <a href="https://www.toontownrewritten.com/">View the project here.</a>)

            <li>Joining a "clan" in Toontown.</li>
            <li>Accidentally making someone quit the aforementioned clan.</li>
            (He hadn't been online in a few months and asked if anyone had stolen his name yet. I answered vaguely 
            [someone had a similar name, but not the exact same, and thus not <i>actually</i> stolen]
            but because I couldn't type quickly enough, he stormed off before I could explain.)
            <li>Sometimes having a naked penguin on Club Penguin because they required an active (monthly) membership to wear clothes.</li>
            <li>Playing mind games on other kids at the Club Penguin Dojo (it was essentially a rock, paper, scissors minigame).</li>
            <li>Downloading Pirate 101 and Wizard 101 every few months and subsequently deleting it because the paywalls made them unplayable.</li>
